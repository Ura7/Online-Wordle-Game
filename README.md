Then, you are directed to the channel selection screen, which offers four different game modes: 5-letter standard game, 6-letter standard game, 5-letter fixed-letter game, and 6-letter fixed-letter game.

After selecting one of these channels, the user is placed in a game room. If no one else is in the room, the user remains on the waiting screen. Once an opponent joins the room, the game begins.

At the beginning of the game, you write a word for your opponent, and your opponent writes a word for you. 


The main objective of the game is that both players write words for each other to guess. The first player to correctly guess the opponent's word wins the game.
